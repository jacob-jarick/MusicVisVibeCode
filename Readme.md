# About

This project serves as a fun way for me to use up credits on github copilot and claude. 

I do actual development but I wanted to have some purely vibe coded projects for both recreation and for testing agentic coding.

Please see folder Manifest for actual markdown files used to guide agents.

**Readme.md** will always be my notes.

**Manifest.md** will be agent notes which the agent will work from.
